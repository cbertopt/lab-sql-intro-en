-- Challenge 1: Identify the Top Complaint Types
SELECT complaint_type, COUNT(*) AS complaint_count
FROM nyc_311_service_requests
GROUP BY complaint_type
ORDER BY complaint_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
/*Analysis: The top five complaint types may include issues such as "Noise," "Sanitation," and "Water Services."
This result highlights critical areas that require attention. If noise complaints are predominant, it may necessitate implementing measures
to improve noise regulation in certain zones.*/


-- Challenge 2: Analyze Complaints by Borough
SELECT borough, COUNT(*) AS total_complaints
FROM nyc_311_service_requests
GROUP BY borough;
/*Analysis: The results will show the total number of complaints by borough. If one borough has significantly more complaints than others,
it could indicate higher population density or a lack of resources in that area. This can help the city prioritize where to focus its efforts and resources.*/

-- Challenge 3: Filtering High-Volume Complaint Types
SELECT complaint_type, COUNT(*) AS complaint_count
FROM nyc_311_service_requests
GROUP BY complaint_type
HAVING complaint_count > 1000;
/*Analysis: Complaint types exceeding 1,000 can signal systemic issues needing urgent attention.
For instance, if "Sanitation" and "Noise" are on this list, it would be prudent for the urban services department to analyze and improve their response
and resources in those areas.*/

-- Challenge 4: Comparison of Boroughs for a Specific Complaint Type
SELECT borough, COUNT(*) AS complaint_count
FROM nyc_311_service_requests
WHERE complaint_type = 'Noise - Residential'
GROUP BY borough;
/*Analysis: Comparing "Residential Noise" complaints by borough can reveal behavioral patterns.
If one borough shows a high number of complaints,it could indicate a quality-of-life issue for its residents.
This analysis can guide the implementation of local noise control policies and foster community collaboration.*/

-- Overall Conclusion
/*The results of these queries not only provide data on citizen complaints but also present an opportunity for local government to enhance quality of life
through better resource allocation and strategic planning. By addressing the most frequent complaints and the most problematic areas,
the city can work towards a healthier and more satisfying environment for its residents. If you need a deeper analysis or a different focus,
just let me know!*/
